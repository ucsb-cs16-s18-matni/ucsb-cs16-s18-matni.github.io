<b>PLEASE MARK YOUR HOMEWORK CLEARLY, REGARDLESS OF IF YOU WRITE IT OUT IN INK OR PENCIL!</b>
<ol markdown="1">

1.(2 pts) What is the most important rule to remember if I want to use a function to read or write a file?
<div style="margin-bottom:6em"></div>

2.(3 pts) If I wanted my double type variables to be displayed in scientific notation, with a precision of 4 decimal places, and always have a plus (+) sign in front of positive numbers, what code should I include in my program before issuing a cout statement?
<div style="margin-bottom:6em"></div>

3.(5 pts) Show the output produced - be precise! - when the following line is executed (assume library <iomanip> is included in the program):

<div markdown="1">
`cout << "*" << setw(3) << 12345 << setw(3) << "*" << endl;`
</div>

<div style="margin-bottom:4em"></div>

4.(10 pts) Show the output produced - be precise! - when the following line is executed (assume library <iomanip> is included in the program):

<div markdown="1">
```cpp
    int pr_number(8);
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++)
    {
        cout << "Project" << setw(2);
        cout << pr_number++ << endl;
    }
```
</div>

<div style="margin-bottom:4em"></div>

5.(5 pts) When testing for end of file, we talked about two methods. What are they and when is each used?
<div class="pagebreak"></div>

6.(10 pts) I have a text file called "t.txt" that contains two entries: "University of California" on one line, and "Computer Science Rules!" on the other line. Show the output produced when the following code (entire program not shown - so assume all the necessary set ups are done) is executed. You are encouraged to also try to compile this in a program to verify your results.

<div markdown="1">
```cpp
  ifstream tin;
  char c;
  tin.open("t.txt");
  tin.get(c);
  while (!tin.eof()) 
  {
    if ( (c != 'e') && (c != 'C') ) cout << c;
    tin.get(c); 
  }  // end while
```
</div>
<div style="margin-bottom:2em"></div>

7.(15 pts) Show the output produced when the following code (entire program not shown) is executed. You are encouraged to also try to compile this in a program to verify your results.

<div markdown="1">
```cpp
    string name = "Porcupine Tree";

    cout << "NAME = " + name << endl;
    cout << name.length() << endl;

    name.erase(8, 6);
    cout << name << endl;
    name.append("Dean WD Morgan");
    cout << name << endl;

    name.insert(22, "@TWD");
    cout << name << endl;
    name.replace(23, 3, "The WD");
    cout << name << endl;

    cout << name.find("WD") << endl;
    cout << name.rfind("WD") << endl;
    cout << name.rfind("cupi") << endl;

    for (int i = name.length(); i > 20; i--)
        cout << name[i-1];
    cout << endl;
```
</div>

8.(20 pts) Using the examples shown in class (<b>non_numbers_char.cpp</b> and <b>non_numbers_string.cpp</b> - look for them in the demo code section of our class website), extend BOTH programs to check not just for numbers, but for *all* alphanumeric characters. Attach your modified programs in a separate sheet to this homework assignment. Please optimize your printout to **not exceed 1 page for this answer**.
<div style="margin-bottom:4em"></div>

9.(30 pts) Write an entire program that will generate 1000 random numbers between 0 and 99 and place them, each on their own line, in a text file. The program will them read the text file and present the user with the squarre root of the sum of all the numbers in the text file on the display (standard output). Attach your program on a separate sheet to this homework assignment. Please optimize your printout to **not exceed 1 page for this answer**.
