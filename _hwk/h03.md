<b>PLEASE MARK YOUR HOMEWORK CLEARLY, REGARDLESS OF IF YOU WRITE IT OUT IN INK OR PENCIL!</b>

<ol markdown="1">
1. (3 pts) What is a run-time error?
	<div style="margin-bottom:6em"></div>

2. (3 pts) You are writing a program that keeps track of a bank account for your customers.
	The program must print out a statement on the computer display that warns the customer that their 
	balance is below $25, but only if they are a "premiere" customers. Which of these choices is correct? 
	Explain WHY?
	<div style="margin-bottom:1em"></div> 
	        
<div markdown="1">
```
A.  if (balance < 25) { cout << "Your balance is under $25 - be careful!"; }

B.  if !((balance > 25) || (type != "premiere")) { cout << "Your balance is under $25 - be careful!"; }

C.  if ((balance < 25) && (type == "premiere")) { cout << "Your balance is under $25 - be careful!"; }

D.  if (!(balance > 25) && (type == "premiere")) { cout << "Your balance is under $25 - be careful!"; }

```
</div>
	<div style="margin-bottom:8em"></div>

3. (10 pts) What will this piece of code print out exactly?
<div markdown="1">
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;
int main () {
   int x(14);
   while (x >= 3) { 
	cout << x << " "; 
	if (!(x % 3)) {
		cout << "Buzz! ";
		if ((x % 2) == 0) cout << "Fizz!"; 
	}
	else cout << "...";
	cout << endl;
	x--;
   }	
   return 0;
}	
```
</div>
<div style="margin-bottom:8em"></div>

<div class="pagebreak"></div>

4. (10 pts) Find 5 mistakes in this C++ code, mark them (circle them, put an arrow, etc...), and label each as "logic" or "syntax" error:
<div markdown="1">
```cpp
#include <iostream>;
use namespace std;
int main () 
	    int a(0);b(0);
		cout << "Enter a number that is either 0 or 1: ";
		cin >> a;
		cout << "Enter another number that is less than 5: ";
		cin >> b;
		switch (a) { 
			case 0: 
			cout << "number is zero.\n"; 
			for (int i = 5; i != b; i++) {
				cout << "extra line " << i << endl;
			}
			break; 
			case 1: 
			cout << "number is one.\n"; 
			if (b > 5) {
				cout << "Han shot first!\n";
			}
			break; 
		}
		return;
```
</div>
	
5.	(20 pts) Write a program that first asks for the name of the user, then asks the user to enter 
	an angle between 0 and 180 degrees. If the user does not enter a correct number 
	the program must start over. Once the correct number is entered, then the program must ask the user 
	if it should calculate the sine, the cosine, or the tangent of the angle. If the user does not enter a 
	valid choice, then the program should ask the same question again. Once the choice is made, the 
	program must do the calculation and present the answer to the user.
	<div style="margin-bottom:1em"></div>
	You must use a switch statement in this program. You may use built-in functions in 
	the <strong>cmath</strong> library for the trigonometric functions. Print out this program on a separate page 
	and submit it attached to this homework assignment.
	
<div class="pagebreak"></div>

6.	(9 pts) We talked about three concepts that are very important to keep straight, and not confuse: (a) function declaration, (b) function definition, and (c) function call. Here is a short C++ program, with line numbers. Please indicate after the program which line number (or range of line numbers, e.g. 3-5 or 7-14) contains the function prototype, function definition, and function call for the isDivisibleBy function.
  
<div markdown="1">
```cpp
1  #include <iostream>
2  using namespace std;
3
4  bool isDivisibleBy(int a, int b);
5
6  int main() {
7     cout << "result for (15,5) is " << isDivisibleBy(5,15) << endl;
8     cout << "result for (15,5) is " << isDivisibleBy(5,15) << endl;
9     return 0;
10  }
11
12  bool isDivisibleBy(int a, int b) {
13    return ( a % b == 0 );
14  }
```
</div>
  
7.	(10 pts) Write a function declaration and a function definition for a function that takes one argument of type int and one argument of type double, and that returns a value of type double that is the average of the two arguments.
	<div style="margin-bottom:17em"></div>

8.(10 pts) Which of these uses of type casting will NOT ensure that f is 1.5? Answer should be (ex1), (ex2), (ex3), or (ex4) (or a combination of those).

<div markdown="1">
```cpp
int a(1), b(2), c(2), d(2), e(2);
double f;

f = (a + b)*c / static_cast<double>(d + e);	// (ex1)
f = static_cast<double>(a + b)*c / (d + e);	// (ex2)
f = (a + b)*static_cast<double>(c) / (d + e);	// (ex3)
f = static_cast<double>((a + b)*(c) / (d + e));	// (ex4)
```
</div>
  
  <div style="margin-bottom:4em"></div>

9.(10 pts) Write a void function that takes in 2 arguments (integer n and string s) and produces a print out of the string 
s n times.

<div class="pagebreak"></div>
10.(10 pts) What is the output of the program below (write it in the space to the right)?

<div markdown="1">
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

void times(int y, int &z) {
  y = y * 9;
  z = z + 9;
  cout << "y=" << y << ", z=" << z << endl;
}

int main() {
  int b = 7, d = 3;
  times(b, d);
  cout << "b=" << b << ", d=" << d << endl;
  return 0;
}
```
</div>

10.(15 pts) Suppose we have a program where the main starts with the line:


<div markdown="1">
```cpp
  int main(int argc, char *argv[])  
```
</div>

  and the program is run with the following command line: &emsp;

<code><b>~jimbo/cs16/myprog 12 dozen eggs</b></code>
<div style="margin-bottom:1em"></div>

Answer the following questions carefully, using the proper quotation marks (where applicable).
<div style="margin-bottom:1em"></div>

What is the value of argc?
<div style="margin-bottom:1em"></div>

What is the value of argv[2][2]?
<div style="margin-bottom:1em"></div>

What is the value of argv[1] and what data type is it?
<div style="margin-bottom:1em"></div>

What is the value of argv[0]?
<div style="margin-bottom:1em"></div>

What is the value of argv[1]/4?
<div style="margin-bottom:2em"></div>

</ol>
