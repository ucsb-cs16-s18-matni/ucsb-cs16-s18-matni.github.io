Read Chapter 2 (If you do not have a copy of the textbook yet, there is one on reserve at the library under "COMP000-STAFF - Permanent Reserve"). ALL YOUR ANSWERS MUST BE WRITTEN ON THIS PAPER.

<ol markdown="1">
1.	(2 pts) Show 2 different ways to initialize variables in C++?
  <div style="margin-bottom:4em"></div>

2.	(2 pts) Is this variable declaration statement in C++ a good one? Why or why not?
<div markdown="1">
`double maguro=50;`
</div>
  <div style="margin-bottom:4em"></div>

3.	(2 pts) How do you write in ONE LINE in C++: Add a to b and subtract that sum from c, then divide that result by d?
  <div style="margin-bottom:4em"></div>

4.	(4 pts) What will appear on the monitor/display when the following C++ statement is executed?
<div markdown="1">
`cout << "My dog likes to eat\t" << 5 << " cans of dog food a day" << " !" << endl;`
</div>
  <div style="margin-bottom:4em"></div>

5.	(16 pts) Write a short program that asks the user to input three double type inputs from the keyboard, the program then shows the user what the 3 numbers entered were. It then multiplies them together, and displays the answer within 5 decimal places.
  <div class="pagebreak"></div>

6.	(8 pts) Mark up this code to show four things that are missing from this program.
<div markdown="1">

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main()
    int a(0),b(0),c(0);
    string quote;
    cout << "Enter 3 numbers separated by spaces: ";
    cin >> a,b,c;
    sum = a + b + c;
    quote = "The sum of these 3 numbers is: "
    cout << quote << sum;
    return 0; 
}
```

</div>
  <div style="margin-bottom:2em"></div>

7.	(6 pts) What is the resulting output display from the following C++ statements? AND EXPLAIN WHY.
    <div style="margin-bottom:0.5em"></div>
<div markdown="1">

```cpp
int x(35), y(5);
bool v, w;
v = (x >= y);
w = ((x/y) == 7);
cout << v << w << endl;
```

</div>
  <div style="margin-bottom:2em"></div>
  
8.	(16 pts) Write a C++ program that takes as input from the user, their favorite integer number and their name. The program then, says "Hello, (user's name here), your favorite number is (user's favorite number here)!". Then the program will will multiply the number they gave you by 5, then multiply that result again by 5, then multiply THAT result AGAIN by 5. The program HAS to do so using one of the C++ shorthands we discussed in class.
  <div style="margin-bottom:1em"></div>
Finally, the program should say "I took your number and multiplied it by 5 THREE times and the result was: (the resulting number here)."
  <div style="margin-bottom:1em"></div>
IMPORTANT NOTE:  You CANNOT write this program using ANY loop statements!

<div class="pagebreak"></div>

9.	(2 pts) Which Boolean operator, when used with 2 logic expressions, yields TRUE if either expression is TRUE?
  <div style="margin-bottom:3em"></div>

10.	(4 pts) What is wrong (if anything) with this C++ expression?
  <div style="margin-bottom:1em"></div>
  <div markdown="1">
```
if (size = 9)
   cout << "The size is too small";
```
  </div>
  <div style="margin-bottom:5em"></div>

11.	(4 pts) Show the output of this code if x is of type int.
<div markdown="1">
```
int x = 20;
while ( x > 0) {
   cout << x << endl;
   x = x â€“ 4;
 }
```
</div> 
 
12.	(6 pts) Write a while loop that prints out these 11 lines: 
<div markdown="1">
```
COUNTDOWN TO ZERO: 10
COUNTDOWN TO ZERO: 9
...
COUNTDOWN TO ZERO: 1
COUNTDOWN TO ZERO: LIFT OFF!
```
</div>
<div class="pagebreak"></div>

13.	(6 pts)  What is the result (i.e. TRUE or FALSE) of the following Boolean operations in C++, given the following:
	x = 7, y = 10, z = 12
	<div style="margin-bottom:0em"></div>
<div markdown="1">
	a) (x == 6)


	b) ((x == 6) || (y < 20))

	
	d) ((!(x < z) || (y > z)) && (z == 12) && (y == 10))
	
	.	
</div>
<div style="margin-bottom:2em"></div>

14.	(4 pts) What is the output of the following statements?
  <div markdown="1">
```
int s = 1;
do
     cout << s << " ";
while (s++ < 5);
```
  </div>
  <div style="margin-bottom:5em"></div>

15.	(4 pts) Same question as above, but the last statement now reads:

  <div markdown="1">
```
while (++s <= 5);
```
  </div>
<div class="pagebreak"></div>

16.	(6 pts) Write a block of statements (like a function, but you don't have to write it like a function) that take three arguments of user inputs of type int and returns a Boolean TRUE if the arguments are in descending order; otherwise, it returns false. You can use any type of C++ statement types that we've gone over in class so far to accomplish this goal. For example, the set of (1, 2, 3) returns FALSE, as does (5, 3, 8), but not (6, 6, 6), nor (10, 6, 4), etc...
  <div style="margin-bottom:30em"></div>

17.	(8 pts) Write a block of statements (like a function, but you don't have to write it like a function) that will repeatedly ask the user to input a number, then print that number multiplied by 23. This repetition only stops when the user enters zero or any negative number as input.
